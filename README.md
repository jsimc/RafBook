# Distributed Social Network Platform

This project is a distributed social network platform inspired by Facebook, enabling file sharing through an asynchronous network. The platform is built using the **Kademlia routing algorithm**, highlighting expertise in distributed systems and peer-to-peer communication.

## Project Overview

- **Distributed Architecture**: The platform is decentralized, allowing users to connect and share files in a peer-to-peer manner.
- **File Sharing**: Asynchronous file sharing is implemented across the network, ensuring efficient data distribution between peers.
- **Routing Algorithm**: The Kademlia routing algorithm is used for decentralized node lookup and data retrieval, improving scalability and fault tolerance.

## Key Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Users communicate directly with each other, without a central server.
- **Kademlia-Based Routing**: Efficient lookup and data sharing using the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (DHT).
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Network communication is non-blocking and allows seamless file sharing between peers.
- **Scalability**: Built to handle large networks with minimal overhead.

## Technologies Used

- **Kademlia**: For distributed routing and data storage.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Implemented asynchronous messaging between nodes.
- **Distributed Systems**: Leveraged core principles for scalability and fault tolerance.
